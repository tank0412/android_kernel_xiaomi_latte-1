config IWLXVT

	depends on IWLWIFI
	select IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TESTMODE
	select IWLWIFI_SUPPORT_DEBUG_OVERRIDES
	help
	  This option enables the xVT operation mode. xVT mode supports
	  special debug and testing operations that are not supported in
	  the standard operation modes, and is used for verification
	  purposes.
	  xVT mode does not support the standard WiFi operations, and
	  does not communicate with the user mode through the nl80211.

	  Enabling this options allows to fully control the HW using
	  an external tool in user space.

	  Say Y if you have the user space application and want
	  to execute debug and testing flows on the HW.

	  This value might get overridden by power_scheme module_param if exists.

	  Scan precedence level defines relative priority of scan comparing to
	  on channel activities.
	  This level is expressed in terms of scan timing - out-of-channel time
	  and scan suspend time.
	  Level 1: scan is of higher precedence, decreasing overall scan
	  duration.
	  Level 2: scan is of lower precedence, increasing overall scan
	  duration.
